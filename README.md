# Google Play Store Apps: Analysis And Rating Prediction

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Google Play Store apps and develop a predictive model for rating prediction. The project aims to uncover valuable insights into the factors influencing app ratings and provide a reliable model that can predict the ratings of new or existing apps based on various features. Develops a predictive model that considers both app-specific features from the Google Play Store dataset and broader market indicators from the Google Stock Market dataset to forecast the app ratings accurately.
Merging app data with stock market data allows for the exploration of potential correlations between app performance (such as ratings, installs, or revenue) and stock market trends. Incorporating stock market data as additional features in predictive models can improve their accuracy and predictive power.
